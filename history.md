This is the homepage for the **History** category, which includes *Geography*.

We have organized history content into five main subcategories:

- [Geography](geography/index.html) (1.9 / 1.9)
- [American History](american/index.html) (1.8 / 1.8)
- [European History](european/index.html) (1.0 / 1.0)
- [World History](world/index.html) (0.8 / 0.8)
- [Ancient History](ancient/index.html) (0.3 / 0.3)

Distribution Note: "Cross History" is given (0.8 / 0.8) and will include trans-regional history, so each of these counts are slight underestimates.
