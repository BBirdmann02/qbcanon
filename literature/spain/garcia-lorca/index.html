<p>The Bridegroom goes out to cut grape vines. His mother is afraid of knives. The Bridegroom’s father and Brother were killed by the Felix family. The Bride used to run around with Leonardo Felix. Felix is currently trying to calm his baby by singing a lullaby about a horse who wouldn’t drink because its hooves were bleeding. He is rough on his horse and claims he’s not. The Bride throws down orange blossoms and says a cold wind is moving through her. Leonardo shows up and talks to the Bride. Leonardo and the Bride obviously have something going on. The Bride and Leonardo have escaped on a horse. A bunch of woodcutters, the moon and an old beggar woman who represents death narrate the scene. The Bridegroom and Leonardo die.</p>
