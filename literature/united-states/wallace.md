### Infinite Jest

North America has formed the Organization of North American Nations (ONAN). Year naming rights are sold to companies. The Wheelchair Assassins fight for Quebec Independence. They try to obtain the title movie, which has druglike effects on people. We jump to the Incandenza family, whose patriarch stuck his head in a microwave after creating Infinite Jest. Joelle has acid thrown in her face by her boyfriend's mom, and becomes a radio personality known as Madame Psychosis.
