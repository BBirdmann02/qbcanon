#### Vilfredo Pareto

He introduced the concept of "indifference curves".

He is the namesake of the Pareto chart, which is a chart that contains both bars and a line graph.

He created the concept of Pareto efficiency or Pareto optimality, which is a condition in which no individual can be better off without making another worse off. By the first theorem of welfare economics, Pareto efficiency holds for any competitive equilibrium. The Kaldor-Hicks criterion generalizes Pareto efficiency to allow for compensation of lost utility.

### Psychology

#### Alfred Adler

He split with Freud over the degree to which neuroses had a sexual basis. He was profoundly impacted by Jan Smuts' holism.

The Neurotic Constitution

#### Albert Bandura

Bobo doll experiment

- studied the effect of watching an adult model on the behavior of children
- children observed an adult interacting with a "Bobo doll"---a large self-righting toy designed to look like a clown

#### Sigmund Freud

The Austrian founder of psychoanalysis. He used the free-association technique to identify neuroses caused by repressed memories. He believed, contra materialists, that many problems were caused by mental states rather than by biochemical dysfunction. He divided the psyche into *id* (illogical passion), *ego* (rational thought), and *superego* (moral and social conscience). He created the concept of the Oedipus complex, that all males go through a stage where they fixate on their mothers and resent their fathers. One odd clue that comes up often is that he used cocaine.

The Interpretation of Dreams

The Psychopathology of Everyday Life

Beyond the Pleasure Principle

Civilization and its Discontents

- "oceanic feeling"
- chronicled the conflict between individuality and society's demand for conformity

#### Carl Jung

The founder of analytic psychology, he split with Freud over the degree to which neuroses had a sexual basis, like Alfred Adler. He created many important concepts in psychology. *Individuation* is the person's relationship with history and mythology. Jung claimed individuation can give meaning to the elderly. *Synchronicity* is two supposedly unrelated events that are still linked in some ways. *Syzygy* is the male and female archetypes, the *animus* and the *anima*, respectively. The *collective unconscious* is the "reservoir of the experiences of our species". Jung divided people into introverts and extraverts. He had a vision of a "monstrous flood" devastating Europe shortly before the outbreak of World War One.

Answer to Job

- "God who knew no moderation in his emotion"

#### Abraham Maslow

A psychologist known almost entirely for his idea of the "hierarchy of needs". In the hierarchy of needs, human needs are placed on a pyramidal scale. Basic needs like food and safety are on the bottom and "self-actualization" is on the top. Self-actualized people are those who understand their individual needs and abilities and who have families, friends, and colleagues that support them and allow them to accomplish things on which they place value. The lowest unmet need on the hierarchy tends to dominate conscious thought.

Motivation and Personality

Toward a Psychology of Being

#### Stanley Milgram

- Punished with increasingly intense electric shocks to test the teachers' willingness to inflict pain under orders
- Learners screamed in pain and pleaded with them to stop, experimenter said “please continue”
- Over 60% of teachers administered shocks so powerful they would have killed the learner if real
- Used to describe the behavior that occurred at Abu Ghraib prison (like Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment)

Small World experiment

- Mailed a number of people in Nebraska and Kansas a package, and asked them to send it to a target in Boston
- If they knew the target directly, they could send it directly to the target. If not, they were to send it to an acquaintance most likely to directly know the target.
- Of the packages that did make it to Boston, they typically did so in five or six steps
- Led to the coining of the phrase “six degrees of separation”
- Important early study of social networks

- Breaching experiments
  - Subway riders asked to give up their seats

#### Ivan Pavlov

A physiologist who originally studied the digestive tracks of dogs (Novel Prize 1904) who happened to perform a psychological experiment. He originally studied transmarginal inhibition, the body's proclivity to shut down when faced with overwhelming pain and stress.

Pavlov's dogs

- First to study the ways in which unconditioned and neutral stimuli could be linked together through repetition to produce a conditioned response
- Noticed his dogs began to salivate as soon as they saw the lab assistant who normally fed them - “psychic secretion”
- Produced the sound of metronome (not bell) and then presented food to the dogs
- Dogs were trained to salivate whenever they heard the metronome/bell
- "Conditional reflex"

#### Jean Piaget

The Swiss founder of developmental psychology. He performed rigorous studies of the way in which children learn and come to understand and respond to the world around them. He divided child development into four stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal. He was a proponent of genetic epistemology. He called new skills and knowledge "scheme". He originated object permanence.

- then placed the dogs in aa new situation where there was control (an easy means of escape)
- those given no control originally made no attempt at escape, they learned helplessness
- major implications for the understanding and treatment of clinical depression via therapy

#### B. F. Skinner

A leading proponent of behaviorism. He claimed that all human actions could be understood in terms of physical stimuli and learned responses. He proposed the idea of *mand*. He taught pigeons to play table tennis using his ideas.

- allows researchers to observe changes in behavior in response to repeated reinforcements or punishments

#### Edward Tolman

He originated the theory of cognitive maps.

#### John Watson

The American psychologist who was the founder of behaviorism. He was heavily influenced by the ideas of Jacques Loeb. He collaborated with Knight Dunlap and Adolf Meyer. He also created the "Twelve Infants Theory"

He was also a marketer, which is kind of weird but comes up in power clues. He created the Marlboro Man and boosted series of Bumble Bee tuna by adding labels saying "Guaranteed not to turn pink in the can!"

- the 11-month-old boy "Albert" was exposed to numerous white fluffy stimuli (rat, rabbit, wool), initially no fear
- then exposed to white rat while banging a bar with a hammer to create a loud, scary noise and burning newspaper
- eventually, Albert reached with distress when exposed to any white fluffy stimuli, including Santa Claus mask
- criticized on ethical and procedural grounds
  - one child identified as potentially being "Little Albert" may have been born with serious cognitive impariment
  - Mary Cover Jones in a response experiment used milk and crackers over two months

#### Phillip Zimbardo

Stanford Prison Experiment

- Designed to study the effects of power dynamics in custodial situations
- Randomly assigned Stanford University students into "prisoners" and "guards"
- Guards could refer to prisoners only by their number, not name

- Described freedom and indulgence in Japan as a U shape, maximized for babies and the old
- claimed the Japanese consider themselves "debtors to the ages and to the world", owing everything to parents, friends, and employers
- Benedict was not actually able to visit Japan because of travel restrictions
  - therefore used war propaganda, the diaries of captured soldiers, newspaper clippings, literature, film, and the work of John Embriee
  - therefore problematic
- chapters
  - "The Dilemma of Virtue"

#### Auguste Comte

The founder of positivism and sociology. He argued that society develops through three stages: theocratic, metaphysical, and positive.

#### Emile Durkheim

He was a French sociologist in the Positivist tradition, a student of Auguste Comte. He wanted to make sociology its own superior field of independent study because he believed that societies cannot be reduced to component parts. He created the concept of "collective effervescence" which is communities coming together and sharing thoughts and actions.

A central concept of Emile Durkheim's was *anomie*, which is a condition of social disintegration. *Anomie* is a state in which rules have lost authority and occurs when a society is in a state of drastic change; older societal norms fade and are not immediately replaced by new ones. In this state of normlessness, members of society are left confused and feeling outcast.
