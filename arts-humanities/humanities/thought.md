He introduced the concept of "indifference curves".

He invented the 80/20 principle, also known as the "law of the vital few", which most generally states that most effects stem from a few causes, but originally held that "80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population".

He is the namesake of the Pareto chart, which is a chart that contains both bars and a line graph.

He created the concept of Pareto efficiency or Pareto optimality, which is a condition in which no individual can be better off without making another worse off. By the first theorem of welfare economics, Pareto efficiency holds for any competitive equilibrium. The Kaldor-Hicks criterion generalizes Pareto efficiency to allow for compensation of lost utility.

### Psychology

#### Alfred Adler

He split with Freud over the degree to which neuroses had a sexual basis. He was profoundly impacted by Jan Smuts' holism.

#### Auguste Comte

He was a French sociologist in the Positivist tradition, a student of Auguste Comte. He wanted to make sociology its own superior field of independent study because he believed that societies cannot be reduced to component parts. He created the concept of "collective effervescence" which is communities coming together and sharing thoughts and actions.

A central concept of Emile Durkheim's was *anomie*, which is a condition of social disintegration. *Anomie* is a state in which rules have lost authority and occurs when a society is in a state of drastic change; older societal norms fade and are not immediately replaced by new ones. In this state of normlessness, members of society are left confused and feeling outcast.
