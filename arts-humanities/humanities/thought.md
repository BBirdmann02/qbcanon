title: Thought

This is the homepage for the *Thought* category, a subcategory of the [Humanities](../index.html).

Many of the notes here have been based off of Joel Miles' outline of important figures in Social Science.

We have divided Thought content into five main subcategories:

- [Philosophy and Theology](philosophy/index.html)
- [Economics](economics/index.html)
- [Psychology](psychology/index.html)
- [Anthropology, Archaeology, and Sociology](anthropology/index.html)
- [Linguistics](linguistics/index.html)
