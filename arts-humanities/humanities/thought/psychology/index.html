<h3 id="alfred-adler">Alfred Adler</h3>
<p>He split with Freud over the degree to which neuroses had a sexual basis. He was profoundly impacted by Jan Smuts’ holism.</p>
<p>The Neurotic Constitution</p>
<ul>
<li>neuroses result from people’s inability to achieve self-realization</li>
<li>in failing to achieve this sense of completeness, they develop “inferiority complexes” which inhibited their relations with successful people and dominated their relations with fellow unsuccessful people</li>
<li>“Individual Psychology”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="solomon-asch">Solomon Asch</h3>
<p>He was a psychologist at Swarthmore college</p>
<p>First Asch conformity experiment</p>
<ul>
<li>tested whether individuals would conform to the thinking of a group of peers when the group was clearly wrong</li>
<li>participants were paired with seven other people who were in on the plan</li>
<li>group was shown a “base” line and then shown three other lines</li>
<li>asked which of the three other lines was the same length</li>
<li>seven confederates each picked the same wrong line</li>
<li>40% of the time, the subject also gave a wrong answer to conform with the group</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="albert-bandura">Albert Bandura</h3>
<p>Bobo doll experiment</p>
<ul>
<li>conducted at Stanford</li>
<li>studied the effect of watching an adult model on the behavior of children</li>
<li>children observed an adult interacting with a “Bobo doll”—a large self-righting toy designed to look like a clown</li>
<li>in some cases, adult ignored doll; in others, the adult was highly aggressive towards it (hitting it with a mallet, throwing it, and yelling at it)</li>
<li>the children who watched the adult who was aggressive towards it were far more likely to also be aggressive towards it</li>
<li>supported Social Learning Theory, which says behaviors may be learned by observing models</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mamie-phipps-clark-and-kenneth-clark">Mamie Phipps Clark and Kenneth Clark</h3>
<p>They were a married team of psychologists, the first African Americans to receive doctorates of psychology at Columbia University.</p>
<p>Clark doll experiment</p>
<ul>
<li>presented children across the country from all races with dolls that were identical except for skin color and hairstyle</li>
<li>asked children to identify “nice doll” and “bad doll” and other subjective judgements</li>
<li>children of all races showed a preference for the white doll</li>
<li>showed racism created an inherent sense of inferiority in black children even by the age of 5</li>
<li>cited by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board as evidence to overturn “separate but equal”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="erik-erikson">Erik Erikson</h3>
<p>A psychologist who coined the term “identity crisis.” He theorized about how social institutions reflect the universal features of psychosocial development. He wrote several psychohistories explaining how people like Martin Luther and Mahatma Gandhi were able to think and act the way they did (<em>Young Man Luther</em>, <em>Gandhi’s Truth</em>)</p>
<p>Childhood and Society</p>

<h3 id="leon-festinger">Leon Festinger</h3>
<p>A psychologist who introduced the concept of cognitive dissonance in his book <em>When Prophecy Fails</em>.</p>
<h3 id="sigmund-freud">Sigmund Freud</h3>
<p>The Austrian founder of psychoanalysis. He used the free-association technique to identify neuroses caused by repressed memories. He believed, contra materialists, that many problems were caused by mental states rather than by biochemical dysfunction. He divided the psyche into <em>id</em> (illogical passion), <em>ego</em> (rational thought), and <em>superego</em> (moral and social conscience). He created the concept of the Oedipus complex, that all males go through a stage where they fixate on their mothers and resent their fathers. One odd clue that comes up often is that he used cocaine.</p>
<p>The Interpretation of Dreams</p>
<p>The Psychopathology of Everyday Life</p>
<p>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</p>
<p>Civilization and its Discontents</p>
<ul>
<li>“oceanic feeling”</li>
<li>chronicled the conflict between individuality and society’s demand for conformity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="carl-jung">Carl Jung</h3>
<p>The founder of analytic psychology, he split with Freud over the degree to which neuroses had a sexual basis, like Alfred Adler. He created many important concepts in psychology. <em>Individuation</em> is the person’s relationship with history and mythology. Jung claimed individuation can give meaning to the elderly. <em>Synchronicity</em> is two supposedly unrelated events that are still linked in some ways. <em>Syzygy</em> is the male and female archetypes, the <em>animus</em> and the <em>anima</em>, respectively. The <em>collective unconscious</em> is the “reservoir of the experiences of our species”. Jung divided people into introverts and extraverts. He had a vision of a “monstrous flood” devastating Europe shortly before the outbreak of World War One.</p>
<p>Answer to Job</p>
<ul>
<li>“God who knew no moderation in his emotion”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="abraham-maslow">Abraham Maslow</h3>
<p>A psychologist known almost entirely for his idea of the “hierarchy of needs”. In the hierarchy of needs, human needs are placed on a pyramidal scale. Basic needs like food and safety are on the bottom and “self-actualization” is on the top. Self-actualized people are those who understand their individual needs and abilities and who have families, friends, and colleagues that support them and allow them to accomplish things on which they place value. The lowest unmet need on the hierarchy tends to dominate conscious thought.</p>
<p>Motivation and Personality</p>
<p>Toward a Psychology of Being</p>
<h3 id="stanley-milgram">Stanley Milgram</h3>
<p>A Yale psychologist who performed a number of interesting experiments. He coined the term “familiar stranger”, which refers to a person one sees regularly but does not interact with.</p>
<p>Shock/Obedience experiment</p>
<ul>
<li>After Nazi Adolf Eichmann’s high-profile trial
<ul>
<li>Claimed that the Nazis carrying out the Holocaust did it because they were merely “following orders”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At Yale University</li>
<li>Tested obedience to authority</li>
<li>Ordered “teachers” to test the memories of “learners” an punish them for wrong answers</li>
<li>Punished with increasingly intense electric shocks to test the teachers’ willingness to inflict pain under orders</li>
<li>Learners screamed in pain and pleaded with them to stop, experimenter said “please continue”</li>
<li>Over 60% of teachers administered shocks so powerful they would have killed the learner if real</li>
<li>Used to describe the behavior that occurred at Abu Ghraib prison (like Zimbardo’s Stanford Prison Experiment)</li>
</ul>
<p>Small World experiment</p>
<ul>
<li>Mailed a number of people in Nebraska and Kansas a package, and asked them to send it to a target in Boston</li>
<li>If they knew the target directly, they could send it directly to the target. If not, they were to send it to an acquaintance most likely to directly know the target.</li>
<li>Of the packages that did make it to Boston, they typically did so in five or six steps</li>
<li>Led to the coining of the phrase “six degrees of separation”</li>
<li>Important early study of social networks</li>
<li>“Lost letter” experiment</li>
<li>Left around letters addressed to hospitals and Nazis an waited to see which got delivered</li>

<h3 id="ivan-pavlov">Ivan Pavlov</h3>
<p>A physiologist who originally studied the digestive tracks of dogs (Novel Prize 1904) who happened to perform a psychological experiment. He originally studied transmarginal inhibition, the body’s proclivity to shut down when faced with overwhelming pain and stress.</p>
<p>Pavlov’s dogs</p>
<ul>
<li>First to study the ways in which unconditioned and neutral stimuli could be linked together through repetition to produce a conditioned response</li>
<li>Noticed his dogs began to salivate as soon as they saw the lab assistant who normally fed them - “psychic secretion”</li>
<li>Produced the sound of metronome (not bell) and then presented food to the dogs</li>
<li>Dogs were trained to salivate whenever they heard the metronome/bell</li>
<li>“Conditional reflex”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jean-piaget">Jean Piaget</h3>
<p>The Swiss founder of developmental psychology. He performed rigorous studies of the way in which children learn and come to understand and respond to the world around them. He divided child development into four stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal. He was a proponent of genetic epistemology. He called new skills and knowledge “scheme”. He originated object permanence.</p>

<li>major implications for the understanding and treatment of clinical depression via therapy</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b.-f.-skinner">B. F. Skinner</h3>
<p>A leading proponent of behaviorism. He claimed that all human actions could be understood in terms of physical stimuli and learned responses. He proposed the idea of <em>mand</em>. He taught pigeons to play table tennis using his ideas.</p>
