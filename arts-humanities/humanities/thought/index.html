<h4 id="vilfredo-pareto">Vilfredo Pareto</h4>
<p>He introduced the concept of “indifference curves”.</p>
<p>He invented the 80/20 principle, also known as the “law of the vital few”, which most generally states that most effects stem from a few causes, but originally held that “80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population”.</p>
<p>He is the namesake of the Pareto chart, which is a chart that contains both bars and a line graph.</p>
<p>He created the concept of Pareto efficiency or Pareto optimality, which is a condition in which no individual can be better off without making another worse off. By the first theorem of welfare economics, Pareto efficiency holds for any competitive equilibrium. The Kaldor-Hicks criterion generalizes Pareto efficiency to allow for compensation of lost utility.</p>

<h4 id="sigmund-freud">Sigmund Freud</h4>
<p>The Austrian founder of psychoanalysis. He used the free-association technique to identify neuroses caused by repressed memories. He believed, contra materialists, that many problems were caused by mental states rather than by biochemical dysfunction. He divided the psyche into <em>id</em> (illogical passion), <em>ego</em> (rational thought), and <em>superego</em> (moral and social conscience). He created the concept of the Oedipus complex, that all males go through a stage where they fixate on their mothers and resent their fathers. One odd clue that comes up often is that he used cocaine.</p>

<h4 id="carl-jung">Carl Jung</h4>
<p>The founder of analytic psychology, he split with Freud over the degree to which neuroses had a sexual basis, like Alfred Adler. He created many important concepts in psychology. <em>Individuation</em> is the person’s relationship with history and mythology. Jung claimed individuation can give meaning to the elderly. <em>Synchronicity</em> is two supposedly unrelated events that are still linked in some ways. <em>Syzygy</em> is the male and female archetypes, the <em>animus</em> and the <em>anima</em>, respectively. The <em>collective unconscious</em> is the “reservoir of the experiences of our species”. Jung divided people into introverts and extraverts. He had a vision of a “monstrous flood” devastating Europe shortly before the outbreak of World War One.</p>

<h4 id="abraham-maslow">Abraham Maslow</h4>
<p>A psychologist known almost entirely for his idea of the “hierarchy of needs”. In the hierarchy of needs, human needs are placed on a pyramidal scale. Basic needs like food and safety are on the bottom and “self-actualization” is on the top. Self-actualized people are those who understand their individual needs and abilities and who have families, friends, and colleagues that support them and allow them to accomplish things on which they place value. The lowest unmet need on the hierarchy tends to dominate conscious thought.</p>

<h4 id="auguste-comte">Auguste Comte</h4>
<p>The founder of positivism and sociology. He argued that society develops through three stages: theocratic, metaphysical, and positive.</p>
<h4 id="emile-durkheim">Emile Durkheim</h4>
<p>He was a French sociologist in the Positivist tradition, a student of Auguste Comte. He wanted to make sociology its own superior field of independent study because he believed that societies cannot be reduced to component parts. He created the concept of “collective effervescence” which is communities coming together and sharing thoughts and actions.</p>
<p>A central concept of Emile Durkheim’s was <em>anomie</em>, which is a condition of social disintegration. <em>Anomie</em> is a state in which rules have lost authority and occurs when a society is in a state of drastic change; older societal norms fade and are not immediately replaced by new ones. In this state of normlessness, members of society are left confused and feeling outcast.</p>
