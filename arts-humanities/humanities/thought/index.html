<h4 id="emile-durkheim">Emile Durkheim</h4>
<p>He was a French sociologist in the Positivist tradition, a student of Auguste Comte. He wanted to make sociology its own superior field of independent study because he believed that societies cannot be reduced to component parts. He created the concept of “collective effervescence” which is communities coming together and sharing thoughts and actions.</p>
<p>A central concept of Emile Durkheim’s was <em>anomie</em>, which is a condition of social disintegration. <em>Anomie</em> is a state in which rules have lost authority and occurs when a society is in a state of drastic change; older societal norms fade and are not immediately replaced by new ones. In this state of normlessness, members of society are left confused and feeling outcast.</p>

<li>observes that suicide is more prevalent among Protestants than Catholics and higher in peacetime than in wartime</li>
<li>he divides the rationales for suicide into four categories
